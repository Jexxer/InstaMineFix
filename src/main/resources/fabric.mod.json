  "description": "This mod was created so that I could instantly break deepslate and deepslate ore instantly with efficiency V and Haste II beacon. It felt a bit cheaty and so I added a new Pickaxe with a custom recipe called the 'True Netherite Pickaxe'. This is crafted like any other pickaxe but with three netherite ingots. Enjoy",
